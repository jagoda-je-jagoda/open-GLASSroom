# Welcome to the Open GLASSroom

**Open GLASSroom** is a collective of glass experts and enthusiasts from six universities: TU Delft, TU Dresden, CTU Prague, Politecnico di Bari, Universitat de Girona, and the University of Rijeka. Together with students, educators, researchers, and practitioners from across Europe, we create high-quality educational materials on glass design and engineering, and share them as Open Educational Resources (OER).

This interactive textbook is designed to guide beginners into the world of glass, offering a structured learning pathway through knowledge clips, reading suggestions, self-assessment quizzes, case studies, calculation examples, and more. We aim to continuously grow this textbook — and with it, our community. Contributions, corrections, and suggestions for improvement are warmly welcomed!
